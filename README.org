** Introduction
When imaging high-speed events, one has to minimise the exposure time
of the camera to avoid blurred images. Depending on the camera model,
this is often only possible to a certain extent. The most
straightforward way to further reduce exposure time is to strobe the
lightsource instead. Here, a simple circuit is shown that allows an
Arduino-compatible microcontroller (here a Teensy 3.2) to strobe LEDs
and laser diodes. A software frontend based on Pure Data (PD) is
provided to facilitate control. You will need a 'global shutter'
camera, which, in contrast to 'rolling shutter' cameras, expose and
read out all lines of the imaging sensor at the same time.

This circuit has been published by Wilson et al. ("Performance
evaluation of an overdriven LED for high-speed schlieren imaging"
S. Wilson, G. Gustafson, D. Lincoln, K. Murari, C. Johansen; J Vis
(2015) 18:35–45, [[HTTP:doi.org/10.1007/s12650-014-0220-7][DOI 10.1007/s12650-014-0220-7]]). In a nutshell, it
uses two big capacitors to deliver a lot of current to the lightsource
in a quick manner. Switching is achieved by a Power MOSFET controlled
by a high-speed MOSFET driver. A Schottky diode protects the circuit.

** Circuit
The circuit can be assembled in a straightforward manner with
stripboard (see schematics and image below). Please also use the
component datasheets for sample circuits and wiring instructions. The
shorter the pulse, the higher voltage an LED or laser diode can
digest. It is therefore convenient to drive the circuit with an
adjustable lab power supply. It is a good idea to buy more than one
LED when exploring the circuit.

** Programming the microcontroller (Teensy 3.2)
You can find the program here ([[./files/strobing.ino]]). It uses the OSC
protocol to get its values from a software frontend made in Pure Data
(PD). Have a look at the code, it contains a fair amount on
documentation and can be changed quite easily. In a nutshell, it
retrieves 'delaytimes' (in microseconds) from the frontend, and uses
an interrupt to pulse the light in desired intervals. As is, simple
'delayMicroseconds' is used to switch the lightsource on for a given
length of time, therefore minimum exposure time is limited to one
microsecond.  For smaller exposure times you can use a signal
generator or play with 'random instructions', eg a little for-loop in
the interrupt instead of 'delayMicroseconds'.

** Software frontend with Pure Data (PD)
To avoid reprogramming the microcontroller to adjust settings, a
simple PD-program is used to control strobing. The version provided
here uses PD's 'Graph on Parent' feature to allow for a clean
interface and is written to use with PD-extended
(https://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended) or PD-L2ORK
(http://l2ork.music.vt.edu/main/make-your-own-l2ork/software/).
Download [[./files/o.io.slipserial.pd]] (a little helper for OSC
communication), [[./files/StrobingPDExtended.pd]] (the program itself
where you can make changes) and [[./files/StrobingPlay.pd]] (the
simplified frontend) into the same folder. 'StrobingPlay' is
configured to quickly adjust the length and number of exposures per
image frame at a given framerate. This might not be convenient for
every experimental setup but can be adapted towards other needs in a
straightforward fashion.

** Why do you want to use strobing?
Strobing light is the easiest way to enhance imaging of fast events -
and allows you to use relatively cheap cameras for microfluidic
rigs. If you expose one frame multiple times, a single image will
contain movement in time, useful for example to calculate velocities
of beads or droplets in a microfluidic channel.

Top: without strobing, LED adjusted to maximum light intensity for the camera (regulates the exposure time of the camera down to 10 microseconds automatically). Bottom: With the LED strobed every 10 microseconds for a duration of 1 microsecond. Due to the minimum exposure time of the camera being 10 microseconds already, image improvement by strobing is smaller than with the FireflyMV. Images have been deinterlaced with a small helper program in PD ([[./files/DeinterlaceWithSave.pd]]).
